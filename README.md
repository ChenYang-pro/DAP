# Accident Risk Prediction based on Heterogeneous Sparse Data: New Dataset and Insights (ACM SIGSPATIAL 2019)

## Data

## Generate Input

## Baseline Models
Baseline models are Logostic Regrassions (LR) and Gradient Boosted classifier  (GBC) implementations.

## DAP Model
Deep Models are using LSTM and FC layers to precidct accident risk. 
## How to Run the Code?
