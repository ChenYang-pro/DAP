# Accident Risk Prediction based on Heterogeneous Sparse Data: New Dataset and Insights (ACM SIGSPATIAL 2019)

## Data
The main data for this work is obtained from [US Accidents](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents) and [Large Scale Traffic and Weather Events](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/lstw) datasets. Several sample data files can be find in ```data``` directory. 

## Generate Input

## Baseline Models
Baseline models are Logistic Regressions (LR) and Gradient Boosted classifier  (GBC) implementations.

## DAP Model
Deep Models are using LSTM and FC layers to predict accident risk. 

## How to Run the Code? 
Download the CSV dataset from here: https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents

Run step1-cleaning-func and step2-acc_prediction_training_preparation in "Step1-preparing for training" folder

Run script in DAB and baseline to train different models.
